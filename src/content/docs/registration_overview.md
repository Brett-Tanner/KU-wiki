This section relates to the seasonal (and party) registration site, built with Ruby on Rails and hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

If anyone other than me reads this, and I didn't have time to go back and clean up, I really do apologise for the code quality. I started this project straight after finishing the Rails path of the Odin Project, and leant **a lot** as I was working on this.
