## KidsUP

### Admin

- Can create/manage all other users
- Can do anything any other role can
- Can access (anonymized) stats for all organisations
- Whatever else Leroy & I think we need

### Curriculum

- Can create new weeks/lessons and edit existing ones
- Has access to chats with customers?

On login sees a folder structure similar to google drive, can create folders and upload files. Needs to be a mass upload feature, at least a week at a time and preferably a month at a time if I can make it fast enough.

Can directly edit metadata for lessons if it needs to be fixed/updated. Also has access to the chat feature, could be an inbox-style thing on the homepage or notifications on the main nav that link to an inbox on another page.

### Sales

- Can add new plans to an organisation
- Can create custom plans
- Can generally manage plans
- Can view all materials for demo purposes?
- Has access to chats with customers
  - Scoped to organisations they're responsible for or all?

Sees a list of organisations and their plans when they log in, as well as some way to go to organisation-specific inboxes which shows a notification badge if there are unread messages.

### School Manager

- Per school, could actually be given to the leader if that makes more sense
- Can manage teachers and students for their school
- Can contact support
- Can see stats for their school
- Everything a teacher can do

Same login view as a teacher but they have the option to add teachers/students and contact support.

### Teacher

- Can access materials
- Can comment on and add test results for students
  - For us this would be by school, maybe we should have 'school' layer below 'organisation'?
- Can contact support?

Calendar nav bar at top is used to navigate between materials for a given day, current day selected at login. Can click on a day to see the materials for that day, maybe buttons to skip ahead/back a month.

## External Organisations

### Organisation Admin
