A guide to accessing rotated logs for the EC2 instance.

`/resources/environments/logs/publish/environment-name/ec2-instance-name`

There are thousands and thousands of them, god help you unless I set up automatic deletion of old logs at some point or I write some docs on accessing S3 from the command line so you can filter them.
