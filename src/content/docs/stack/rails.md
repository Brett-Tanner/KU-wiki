## Handy commands

When using ssh, navigate to the project folder using `cd /var/app/current` before running any rails-specific commands.

`bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production` to run migrations in production
`RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails c` to access the rails console in production
