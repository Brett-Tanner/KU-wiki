## Getting started

- `npm run dev` from the project folder will build your site, update on any changes and make it available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Fun Markdown features

- Standard [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) syntax applies
- Headings will automatically be generated with anchor links
- `&lt;h2&gt;` and `&lt;h3&gt;` are automatically added to the table of contents. Don't use `&lt;h1&gt;`, it's reserved for the main page title
- Use &lt; &gt;
- In code blocks, you can put the name of the relevant language after the opening backticks and Starlight will handle syntax highlighting for you.
