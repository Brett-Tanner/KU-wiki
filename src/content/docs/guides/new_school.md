## Information you'll need

  - Select the school photo
  - Select 'Schools' from the 'Folder' dropdown
  - Enter 'setsu_calendar' in the 'Event' field
  - Hit upload
- Optionally, you can select current school manager/s from the list when creating the school
  - If you want to do it this way, you'll need to create the new school manager before creating the school
  - It's possible to do this later by editing the school
  - Or editing/creating the manager you want to be responsible
- School name
- School email address (not required to be unique)
- Street address
- Prefecture
- Phone
- List of nearby schools
- List of bus areas
- List of nearby train stations
- All the hiragana you want the school to be searchable by in the Setsumeikai calendar

## Process

1. While logged in as an admin, go [here](https://kids-up.app/en/areas)
2. At the top of the page, click 'Create School'
3. Fill out the form with the information mentioned [above](#information-youll-need)
4. Add managers if you want to at this stage
5. Submit the form to create the school
6. You'll probably want to take note of its ID, shown in the URL of the page you're redirected to after creation, so you can use it on the WP site to link to the Setsumeikai calendar for that school
