## Addons

- Need to track what extra courses they've paid for (like online, keep up)

## Contracts

### Fields

- Type: Individual/Monthly
- Status: not finalized/confirmed/cancelled/invalid

## Emails

Non-admin users may need to be able to schedule/search scheduled email jobs, probably make a separate queue to enable this.

## Students

Students seem to have basically everything on them, especially the search form allows searching for stuff like parent/contract details which would probably be better to search from a controller specific to them.

Need to have some stuff configurable per organisation, like maybe levels? Also additional fields for details (maybe, will talk about likelihood of unique stuff here).

### New fields

- Gender (including unknown)
- Join/withdrawal dates
- Card status/number
- Pickup/dropoff location

## Parents

### New fields

- Payments related details
- Multiple emails
