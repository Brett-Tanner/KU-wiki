This site was originally created to replace the previous registration process for seasonal events. It has since grown to encompass many more features and events than originally intended, including setsumeikais, surveys and single day parties like Chocolate Party & Science Day.

This page starts by explaining the previous event registration process and comparing it to the current site for context, then provides a thorough explanation of the site's current features.

## Customers

### Historical Context

Parents registered for activities from a Google Form, which updated a Google Sheet containing all the registrations for a given school.

This was not a great experience for parents, who had to register for each activity from a different page, re-enter their information and their child's for each event, and repeat the entire process for each child.

It was also impossible to edit a booking once made without contacting the school, creating extra work for both parents and school managers.

By contrast the site allows all activities and options to be registered for from a single page by clicking toggles, saves parent & child information between events (and updates children with information from the SS) and allows registrations for one child to be copied to a sibling with the click of a button.

Customers can edit their booking at any time prior to its confirmation by the SM, without any interaction by KU staff.

Screenshots for customer features are provided in mobile format, as analytics show this is how most customers interact with the site.

## School Managers & above

### Historical Context

Staff managed registrations for each event using a Google Sheet which took minutes to load and would often become unresponsive, requiring another minutes-long reload.

Email templates were provided, but could only be sent by manually copying the template into a separate email client, and there was no way of verifying student or parent information.

The site replaced the Google Sheet with a simple table on a web page, which commonly loads in less than a second and never more than 2-3 seconds.

Emails are sent automatically on booking creation, confirmation and any changes. Student information is known to be correct as it's provided by the SS, and parents/child details are only a click or two away from the table.

## Tech Stack

The site is a Ruby on Rails app running on AWS. Rails handles both the back and frontend, with templating originally done in ERB and slowly transitioning to HAML. Client side interactivity is handled by a mix of Bootstrap components and Stimulus.js, with Bootstrap and some custom CSS used for styling.

Hosting is handled by AWS Elastic Beanstalk on the Ruby platform, the domain is managed by Onamae (hopefully transitioning to Cloudflare in August) and Route 53 is the authoritative nameserver. The database is an RDS postgres instance, email is handled by SES and object storage by S3.

Analytics provided by Microsoft Clarity.

### Bookings (model name is Invoice)

- Have an automatically generated summary which gives a list of all activity/option registrations and adjustments together with some basic info about the child
- Have a full version history which can be seen on the booking page, with the summary of the booking at that time, user who made the change and timestamp
- Have adjustments
  - Some are automatically applied based on certain criteria, like the hat adjustment for outdoor activities if the registered child doesn't have a KidsUP hat
  - Can also be manually applied by staff
  - Validations prevent them reducing the total cost of the booking below 0
- Activity registrations
  - Displayed in a list with the activity name, whether it's morning or afternoon and any options selected for that activity
  - Cost for all activities is broken down in the summary section, with the number/type of courses used and their prices shown
- Option registrations
  - Listed alongside the time slot they apply to in the activity list
  - Grouped by name and summarized with total cost for that option name in the summary section
  - Auto-destroyed if associated slot is de-registered

- Emails with an attached summary and autogenerated PDF breakdown of the costs are automatically sent on every change to the booking
  - Confirmation emails can be automatically sent when the booking is confirmed or copied from a template at the discretion of the SM

### Events

- Have their own options which apply event-wide
  - Currently only photo service is ever added, but multiple such options can be added
  - Uses the same Option model as activity options through a polymorphic association
- All activities and options can be registered for from a single page
- A live calculation of the cost for the active child is shown at the bottom of the screen
  - This live calculation is also responsible for adding/removing hidden fields from the form submitted to confirm the booking details
  - There's a set of 3 stimulus controllers which pass messages to each other to handle each registration/unregistration
- Further details about the registered activities and any extra costs can be found in a collapsible summary on that bottom bar
- There is also a live calculation of the total cost for that family for the current event at the top of the page
- Time Slots
  - Can be manually opened and closed, preventing further registrations
  - Also automatically close on a given date
  - Can be one of a few categories (seasonal, special, outdoor and party) which have different behaviours/costs
  - Have start and end times, as well as a boolean representing whether they're a morning or afternoon slot
  - Automatically track their registration count using counter_cache
  - Have cost modifiers for internal/external/kindy/elementary students
  - Have a snack boolean which affects their price in front and backend calculations
  - For any category other than special, the afternoon slot is automatically created from the morning slot's information, with default options
- Time slot options
  - Options have a polymorphic association to either an event or TimeSlot
  - Options have a category, which affects how it's displayed on the registration screen, attendance sheets and what validations are applied to it
  - Some categories have a modifier, like arrival and departure options, which represents how long before or after the activity the student can arrive/leave

### Setsumeikais/Inquiries

- School and area managers can create setsumeikais at their managed schools
  - Existing setsumeikais can be edited, and copied for faster creation of similar setsumeikais
- Created with a scheduled start date/time, attendance limit, venue school, involved schools, release date and close date
- Are then provided to the React-based registration flow I created through an API
  - The current list of schools and their information/images is also provided through this API
  - A second, simpler API serves just the school names and IDs to the general inquiry form
- When customers complete the registration flow (or the separate general inquiry form I also created) their inquiry is sent to another API on the event site and stored in its database
- Staff can view setsumeikai or general inquries related to their managed schools from the event site
  - Setsumeikais and inquiries are paginated by school, then groups of 20
  - a navbar is provided to switch between setsumeikais/inquiries for different schools, for those staff members with permission to view multiple schools
- The inquiries are also provided to the legacy GAS sheets through an authenticated API to prevent 3rd parties obtaining customer personal information
  - After inquiries are sent to the GAS sheet, they're marked as sent to avoid duplication of inquiries

### Statistics Dashboard

- Divded into separate pages for Activities, Bookings, Children, Coupons, Edits, Options and Setsumeikais
- The secondary nav also allows filtering by event and school
- For setsumeikais, it's possible to filter by area and school instead
- Each page has multiple charts showing various statistics related to that category, some of which I added on my own initiative and others requested by Jack/Leroy
- This is a pretty large part of the site but no screenshots or details because it's sensitive business information
  - If you're an internal manager ask me and I can show it to you
