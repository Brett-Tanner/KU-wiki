For each of the sections, a good way to get a list of all the fields would be to download the sample CSV from the import page. They seem to be pretty comprehensive.

## Addons

- Need to track what extras they've paid for (like online, keep up)

## Contracts - 契約

## Courses - コース

## Emails

Non-admin users may need to be able to schedule/search scheduled email jobs, probably make a separate queue to enable this.

## Lessons - レッスン

## Rooms - ルーム

## Students

Students seem to have basically everything on them, especially the search form allows searching for stuff like parent/contract details which would probably be better to search from a controller specific to them.

Need to have some stuff configurable per organisation, like maybe levels? Also additional fields for details (maybe, will talk about likelihood of unique stuff here).

### New fields

- Gender (including unknown)
- Join/withdrawal dates
- Card status/number
- Pickup/dropoff location

## Parents

### New fields

- Payments related details
- Multiple emails
